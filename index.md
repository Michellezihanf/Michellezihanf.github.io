# Working Experience

## CERN 
### Fellow on Scientific Computing. IT-LCG-TC Group

- **Coordinator** of the [ESCAPE Virtual Research Environment VRE](https://vre-hub.github.io/) innitiative: 
  - Maintenance and development of the VRE platform, a community-driven analysis facility that allows end-to-end scientific analyses.
    - Through a unique login ([ESCAPE INDIGO IAM](https://indigo-iam.github.io/v/current/)) the VRE links interactive Notebooks (JupyterHub) with a scientific data management service ([RUCIO](https://rucio.cern.ch/) framework) and enables the offloading of workflows to a platform focused on scientific reproducibility ([REANA](https://reana.io/)) both via CLI and JupyterLab extensions.
    - The platform runs on a Kubernetes cluster that provides access to the underlying CERN infrastructure: EOS, CEPHFS, CVMFS, and the CERN database, monitoring, and networking services.
  - **Coordination** of the ESCAPE Open Collaboration VRE Working Group: monthly meetings with ESCAPE partners to align long-term activities on analysis facilities, data access, and offloading of scientific workflows.
- **Technical liaison** for CERN data management and data access activities within the **InterTwin EU project**.
- Member of the CERN EOSC Federation taskforce: Onboarding of the VRE into the [EOSC EU Node](https://eosc.eu/building-the-eosc-federation/eosc-node-cern/) during the [build-up phases of the EOSC Federation](https://home.cern/news/news/computing/cern-joins-build-phase-eosc-federation).
- Rucio **developer** and **deputy of the Rucio JupyterLab extension component**. Contributor to data management infrastructure for small and medium CERN experiments, and member of the IT Analysis Facility working group.
- **Supervisior** of 3 CERN Summer Student projects: [REANA](https://github.com/vre-hub/reana-jupyterlab-extension) & [Zenodo](https://github.com/vre-hub/zenodo-jupyterlab-extension) extensions and their [OAuth2.0 implementation](https://zenodo.org/records/17053241).

Technologies used: **DevOps & Cloud** (Kubernetes, Helm, K9s, Flux, Docker, Singularity, GitHub actions, GitLab CI/CD, OpenStack, ArgoCD), **Software development & Data Analysis** (Python, Bash scripting, git, CVMFS, REST APIs), **Project Management** (Agile, Scrum), **Data Management Frameworks** (Rucio, FTS3, gfal2), **Computing Platforms** (Reana, JupyterHub), **AunthN/Z** (INDIGO IAM, OAuth2.0, OIDC), **Monitoring tools** (Grafana, Kibana, Prometheus), **Relational Databases** (Postgres, MySQL) and **Web technologies** (NodeJS, JavaScript).

## LAPP/CNRS-IN2P3 
### Data and Software Engineer. CTA/HESS High energy gamma-ray astrophysics group.

 - Developer of software libraries and data analysis pipelines for the LST and CTA collaborations.
   - Integration of the [Real Time Analysis pipeline](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/CTA-LAPP/rta) in the [CTA/ACADA framework](https://www.ctao.org/emission-to-discovery/data-and-computing/).
 - Joint responsibility for the technical implementation of the [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu/) (EC-H2020 project) Open-Source Scientific and Service Repository (OSSR) work-package.
 - Tutor in the ESCAPE [2021](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/20306/page/2707-list-of-tutors) and [2022](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/26913/page/3012-speakers) summer schools & LST [2022](https://github.com/cta-observatory/2022_01_lstchain_school) LST data analysis school.
 - Teaching assistantship at Annecy IUT (Université Savoie-Mont Blanc), teaching hands-on exercises (TPs) during 3 semesters for electrical engineering and industrial computing students.
 - Shift operator for the LST-1 Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (1 month onsite and 1 year remote).
 
 Technologies used: Python, Bash scripting, Docker, SLURM, git, GitHub actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins.
