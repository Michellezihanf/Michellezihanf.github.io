# ByteMX

**Role:** 2D Artist, UI/UX Designer  
**Project Type:** Client project with *Ruach Bicycle Club* (Pittsburgh-based afterschool STEM program)

## Project Overview
ByteMX is an educational digital simulation and game designed to help students learn engineering concepts through the design, modeling, and testing of BMX pump tracks. The project integrates interactive play with STEM learning objectives while highlighting the social and community value of pump track parks.

## Design and Research Contributions
I worked as a 2D artist and UI/UX designer, focusing on creating an intuitive and age-appropriate interface within Unity. My responsibilities included making visual and interaction design decisions, designing and implementing UI elements, and mapping the overall user flow to ensure smooth transitions between features and modes of interaction.

Throughout development, we conducted frequent playtesting sessions over the semester. Through direct observation and interviews with participants, we identified usability challenges and refined the interface to better support the target audience. This iterative process strengthened the clarity, accessibility, and engagement of the experience.

## Documentation and Design Handoff
In addition to design and evaluation work, I authored the project handoff document, which consolidated all non-code aspects of the project. This documentation detailed system usage, feature descriptions, design rationale, known limitations, and guidance for future development teams. Writing this document reinforced my understanding of design communication, sustainability of interactive systems, and collaboration across disciplines.
