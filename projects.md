## BotMania

**Role:** 2D Artist, UI/UX Designer, Assistant Producer  
**Project Type:** Client project with *Give Kids the World* (non-profit organization)

**Project Overview**  
BotMania is a motion-tracking educational game developed to introduce children to STEAM concepts through embodied interaction and playful learning. The project aimed to create an engaging and accessible experience for young users by combining physical movement with interactive digital content.

**Design and Research Contributions**  
I designed the end-to-end user experience, including user flow development, storyboard sketching for rapid iteration, UI asset design, and 2D animation production. I also supported production management by coordinating timelines and facilitating cross-disciplinary collaboration.

A central component of the project involved iterative user testing with children in the target age range. I observed user behavior during play sessions, developed design-oriented questions to elicit meaningful feedback, and translated observational insights into design iterations. This process provided hands-on experience with user-centered design, formative evaluation, and qualitative observation methods within an HCI context.

## Autonomous E-Bike Interaction Design Project

**Role:** Interaction Designer  
**Project Type:** Graduate-level Human–Computer Interaction course project

**Project Overview**  
This project explored the interaction design of an autonomous e-bike system, focusing on both digital and physical interfaces to support safe and intuitive user experiences. The final outcome was a comprehensive design document developed in Figma, detailing autonomous features, on-bike physical controls, and a companion city e-bike application.

**Design and Research Process**  
The project began with mixed-methods research, including a literature review on e-bike usage and autonomy and primary user interviews. Based on these findings, we identified key user pain points related to safety, control, and trust in autonomous systems.

To support rapid iteration, we developed low-fidelity physical prototypes using inexpensive materials such as cardboard and conducted formative user testing. These prototypes enabled early evaluation of interaction concepts and informed iterative refinement of both physical and digital interfaces. In parallel, we designed a digital interface for a city-scale e-bike application integrating autonomous features and rider feedback.

**Learning and HCI Foundations**  
This project strengthened my understanding of interaction design fundamentals and frameworks, including the Double Diamond design process and Jesse James Garrett’s model of user experience. I gained experience applying information architecture principles and using low-cost prototyping as a design research tool to support user-centered product development.
